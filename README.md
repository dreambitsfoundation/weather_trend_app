# Weather Trend App

This application is developed to generate bulk report based on a location and a date window from OpenWeatherMap API.

## Items that were completed

- Country Lookup
- City Lookup (required to make query)
- Date picker.

## Items that could not be established

- Report file generation.
  Reason: API integration is done but to generate historic weather data from OpenWeatherMap we need to buy a paid subscription.
  I tried looking for alternatives but could not find any.

_Note: Trend will also be visibe when we will be able to extract the data from the API._

## Installation instruction

1. Install all dependencies
   `npm install`

2. Run the project locally using
   `npm run dev`
